Functional-Filet is stable only from version 0.5.0, any previous version corresponds to the development phase.

However, there are several possible optimizations, in particular on the restructuring of *Torch* tensors in Python which could be done in C++. For this, it is possible that there will be several code modifications in the future.


The documentation includes more detailed [installation and examples instructions](/notebook.ipynb).
